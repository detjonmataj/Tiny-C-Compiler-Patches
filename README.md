# Tiny C Compiler Patches
During my experience with the C programming language, I have come across many problems. I realized that some things could be changed to improve the user experience with the language. In this repository, you will find patches for a lightweight C compiler called TinyC, where I implemented new features and improved existing ones. I chose this compiler because it is small, safe, fast, etc. References: https://bellard.org/tcc/
