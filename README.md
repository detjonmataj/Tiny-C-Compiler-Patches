# Tiny C Compiler Patches

During my experience with the C programming language, I encountered many problems and I think that some things should change. In this repository you will find my patches to a light C compiler called TinyC. I've chosen this compiler because it's small, safe, fast, etc. References: [TinyC Compiler](https://bellard.org/tcc/)
